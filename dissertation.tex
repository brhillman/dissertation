%
%    Revised for version 2015/03/03 of uwthesis.cls
%
%    This document is contained in a single file ONLY because
%    I wanted to be able to distribute it easily.  A real thesis ought
%    to be contained on many files (e.g., one for each chapter, at least).
%
%    To help you identify the files and sections in this large file
%    I use the string '==========' to identify new files.
%
%    To help you ignore the unusual things I do with this sample document
%    I try to use the notation
%       
%    % --- sample stuff only -----
%    special stuff for my document, but you don't need it in your thesis
%    % --- end-of-sample-stuff ---


%    Printed in twoside style now that that's allowed

\vita{Benjamin was born in Edmonds, Washington in 1984. He earned an associates degree from Shoreline Community College in 2005, his bachelors degree from Western Washington University in 2008 (with majors in Physics and in Mathematics), and his masters degree in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Washington in 2012. Upon completion of his Ph.D., he will be taking a postdoctoral appointment at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Outside of science, Benjamin enjoys spending time with friends and family, all things outdoors, and is an avid ice hockey player and competitive Olympic-style weightlifter.}
