# Summary and implications

Accurate representation of clouds in large-scale (global) climate models is of critical importance, but has remained elusive for model developers. An important test of the fidelity of models is the comparison of simulated climate against available observations of the physical climate. For cloud properties, this often means comparison with satellite-retrievals, but these types of comparisons have traditionally been challenged by fundamental limitations in both the satellite retrieval process and in the model formulation of clouds. An increasingly common approach to reconcile these limitations is to use the simulator framework, whereby psuedo-retrievals are simulated from model cloud fields to account for some of the known features and limitations of specific satellite retrievals. While this approach has nominally enabled more consistent comparisons between modeled and observed cloud properties, it is demonstrated here that limitations in both the retrievals and in the models themselves remain unaccounted for, and in particular limitations on the model side introduce an additional layer of uncertainties that need to be accounted for.

The simulation of satellite-retrieved cloud properties from the description of clouds provided by a large-scale model is a multi-step process, involving 1) downscaling model gridbox-mean quantities to scales approximating satellite pixels, 2) simulating the individual satellite retrievals, and 3) aggregating the pixel-scale psuedo-retrievals into statistical summary products analogous to those produced for the individual satellite instruments. In general there can be uncertainties associated with each of these steps, and the primary goal of this study has been to quantify (and reduce) uncertainties and biases related to both steps 1) and 2).

The performance of the MISR simulator is evaluated in Chapter 2 by comparing psuedo-retrievals simulated from CloudSat and CALIPSO data with retrievals from MISR. The MISR simulator is able to correct for many of the features of the MISR retrieval, and in general cloud top heights retrieved from CloudSat and CALIPSO are in much better agreement with MISR after using the MISR-simulator to account for the features of the MISR retrieval. Mid and high-topped clouds are in particularly good agreement between MISR and CloudSat/CALIPSO retrievals when using the MISR simulator. Large differences remain in total and low-topped clouds, however, due to ambiguiuties in retrieving small (sub-pixel) scale clouds. The differences highlighted here between MISR and CloudSat/CALPISO cloud area are discouraging because they represent a fundamental uncertainty in the quantification of low-topped and total cloud area, making robust comparisons of modeled cloud area with these satellite retrievals difficult. More importantly, these differences point to the fragility of cloud area as a measure of cloudiness.

Because current global climate models do not explicitly resolve clouds at the scales at which satellite retrievals are performed, the additional step of downscaling cloud properties to pixel scales is needed before simulating the satellite retrievals. This process depends on additional assumptions about the unresolved cloud properties. In particular, cloud (and precipitation) condensate is nearly always assumed to be horizontally homogeneous on the scale of model gridboxes, and clouds are assumed to follow a simple "maximum-random" overlap. It is shown here that MISR-simulated cloud area is sensitive to both of these assumptions, while simulated CloudSat radar reflectivity is sensitive primarily to the treatment of precipitation and to the subgrid-scale variability in condensate. These errors can be quite large regionally, and have significant consequences for the suitability of these simulators for model evaluation. The errors in CloudSat-simulated radar reflectivity that arise due to these assumptions are particularly large, and until these errors are corrected for, CloudSat radar reflectivities are probably not a suitable quantity for model evaluation.

The errors in simulated psuedo-retrievals that arise due to the generation of subcolumns from model gridbox-mean quantities can be significantly reduced with an improved subcolumn treatment that accounts for both horizontal variability in condensate amount and more realistic overlap of clouds and precipitation. The subcolumn scheme described by [@raisanen_et_al_2004] is implemented here for use in COSP, and significant reduction in errors due to generating subcolumns is demonstrated using the new scheme. The performance of this improved subcolumn generator depends, however, on the specification of cloud and precipitation overlap and rank correlation statistics, as well as on the subgrid-scale variance in condensate. These are all quantities which will need to be parameterized for implementing this improved subcolumn generator for use with global models. Using idealized overlap statistics and variance results in a significant reduction in errors, but more modest results are obtained using a simple parameterization of these quantities. Nonetheless, the improvements demonstrated using the idealized quantities shows that further work to better parameterize these quantities will be worthwhile, and that this framework can significantly improve comparisons between models and satellite retrievals.

It is important to note that the errors identified here are intrinsic to the model evaluation process itself, and not directly connected to inherent errors in the formulation of a particular model. In other words, these errors arise on the *diagnostic* side, not on the model side. This is significant, because it means that if these errors go unaccounted for, we may draw incorrect conclusions about the models we evaluate. 

The importance of overlap and condensate heterogeniety extend beyond just the simulation of psuedo-satellite retrievals. In particular, both of these characteristics of clouds are important in simulating radiative fluxes, and in predicting microphysical process rates. This makes future work to improve the characterization of these quantities even more important. With the growing interest in statistical or PDF-based cloud schemes in large-scale models, it might ultimately make sense for subgrid-scale variance (and, perhaps, condensate probability distributions) to be specified by these schemes within the model, rather than by some external parameterization of the variance with an assumed distribution. Certainly, if such an assumption is made within the model, it makes sense for the same assumptions to be used on the diagnostic end. Regardless, it is clear that the representation (or implicit assumption) of cloud properties at scales below those resolved by global climate models is in dire need of improvement.

While the primary goal of this work has been to evaluate and reduce the errors in satellite diagnostics that arise due to unresolved cloud properties, this work also presents a step forward in the understanding and quantification of these unresolved cloud and precipitation properties. Traditionally, analysis of small-scale cloud statistics has been limited to direct in-situ observations of cloud properties using aircraft observations or tethered balloons, retrievals using a few select ground-based sites, retrievals using satellite observations, or limited area CRM or LES studies. Each of these sources of information carry with them specific strengths and limitations. The use of model output from the Multi-scale Modeling Framework presented here demonstrates a potentially new avenue for exploring the small (subgrid-scale) properties of cloud and precipitation condensate distributions. Using such model output for the study of cloud and precipitation condensate distributions has the advantage of providing resolved information about small-scale cloud and precipitation systems with global coverage, spanning a full range of atmospheric conditions and cloud regimes. This comprehensive spatial coverage is not possible using in-situ observations or ground-based retrievals, and satellite-based retrievals of cloud properties are notoriously difficult to interpret and frought with uncertainties and limitations. Of course, this approach is limited by the fidelty of the model itself, and the fact that simulated cloud systems may not be consistent with clouds in the physical atmosphere. Because of this, the idea of using models to derive parameterizations for use in other models is somewhat controversial. However, as global-scale high-resolution modeling frameworks like the MMF become more sophisticated and simulations improve (or as computational resources grow to accomodate true global cloud resolving models), the prospect of using such global simulations for the purpose of informing parameterizations for use in large-scale models becomes more reasonable.
